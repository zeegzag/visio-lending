# **Design Document**

## **Overview**

This design document outlines the implementation of an **Event Management API** using Django Rest Framework (DRF). The system provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing events, logging mechanisms, and filtering capabilities.

---

## **1. Design Decisions**

### **1.1 Use of Django Rest Framework (DRF)**

- **Why DRF**: DRF simplifies API creation and allows clean implementation of RESTful services.
- **Choice of `ModelViewSet`**:
  - `ModelViewSet` provides a clean abstraction for CRUD operations.
  - Reduces boilerplate code as it automatically handles `list`, `create`, `retrieve`, `update`, and `destroy` views.

### **1.2 Logging**

- **Why Logging**:
  - Logs allow monitoring of critical operations (creation, update, deletion, retrieval).
  - Useful for debugging and auditing system usage.
- **Implementation**:
  - `perform_create`, `perform_update`, and `perform_destroy` methods log events.
  - Logs are handled using Python’s `logging` module for simplicity and configurability.

### **1.3 Filtering and Ordering**

- **Use of `DjangoFilterBackend`**:
  - Allows dynamic filtering of events based on `date` and `location` fields.
- **Ordering**:
  - Events can be ordered by `date`.
  - Default ordering: Descending order of `date` (newest first).

### **1.4 URL Structure**

The API endpoints are structured as follows:

- `GET /api/events/` → List events (with filters)
- `POST /api/events/` → Create a new event
- `GET /api/events/{id}/` → Retrieve event details
- `PUT /api/events/{id}/` → Update an existing event
- `DELETE /api/events/{id}/` → Delete an event

---

## **2. Assumptions**

- **Event Data**:
  - Events have a title, date, location, and description.
  - The database has no restrictions on the number of events.
- **Client Usage**:
  - Clients use the provided API endpoints for CRUD operations.
  - `application/json` is used for request and response payloads.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Standard DRF error responses are sufficient for invalid requests (e.g., missing fields, invalid IDs).
- **Logging Destination**:
  - Logs are configured to write to a file named `events.log` in the project directory.

---

## **3. Suggestions for Future Improvements**

1. **Pagination**:

   - Introduce pagination for `GET` requests to handle large event datasets efficiently.
   - Use DRF's built-in pagination classes like `PageNumberPagination`.

2. **Search Functionality**:

   - Add search filters for event titles and descriptions using `SearchFilter`:
     ```python
     filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend, filters.OrderingFilter, filters.SearchFilter]
     search_fields = ['title', 'description']
     ```

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:

   - Add token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to secure API endpoints.
   - Restrict CRUD operations based on user roles and permissions.

4. **Error Handling Improvements**:

   - Implement custom error responses for better client feedback.
   - Example: Return meaningful messages for invalid IDs or empty payloads.

5. **Event Notifications**:

   - Add functionality to send email notifications when an event is created or updated.

6. **Unit Testing**:

   - Enhance unit tests to cover edge cases, like invalid input data, and ensure API reliability.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Use Docker to containerize the application for easy deployment.
   - Consider hosting on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.

## **4. Conclusion**

The current implementation meets the basic requirements for event management, including full CRUD operations, logging, and filtering. Future enhancements like pagination, search functionality, and improved error handling can further improve the API's usability, scalability, and security.
